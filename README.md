### What is Dragon-Proxy
DragonProxy is a Bridge placed between a Minecraft Bedrock client and a Java Minecraft server.

- Chat supported
- Chunks supported
- Movement supported
- Block break / place supported

## Current job-list 
https://github.com/DragonetMC/DragonProxy/issues/132

## Known bugs/issues
 - No creative inventory
 - Movements on stairs/half blocks
 - with windows 10 sometimes If you try to run Dragon-Proxy on the same computer you start Minecraft W10 Edition on,you may experience problems, if so you must enable [loopback for Minecraft protocol](http://pmmp.readthedocs.io/en/rtfd/faq/connecting/win10localhostcantconnect.html) .
 - __Servers with Certain Anti-cheat Plugins can sometimes register some movements as speed-hacks/flying. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**__
If you get banned from a server, we do not take responsibility!


## Won't fix/implements :
 - Older protocol compatibility (including plugins like ViaVersion)
